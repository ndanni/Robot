# Robot
Robotic arm developed on unity studio using c#
**Motivation**
In stacking during warehousing, the robotic arm is very helpful as it is able to pick
objects where the human arm cannot reach. It has more endurance in holding
objects for a long duration, unlike the human arm that gets weary and tired after
holding objects for a while.
**Why Robotic Arm**
It is very effective in warehousing and stacking as it is able to do more work than the
human arm. It also has the ability to pick and drop weighty objects, unlike the human
arm.

**Requirements**
Unity studio version 2020.3.12f1
Visual studio

**Setting up**
Following the tutorial in the youtube link, I downloaded and launched the program in
my unity environment.
**What I did differently:**
The tutorial already had the asset which is the robot arm so there was no need to
purchase one from the asset store in unity.
The script on the tutorial was in Javascript. My preferred coding language is C#.
I implemented the kinetics of the robotic arm in C#.
I worked on the upper arm, lower arm, robot base, and nozzle of the robot. The
tutorial only worked on the upper arm and robot base.
